📌 Enhancing User Engagement & Conversion for FlexTrade
🚀 Project Overview
FlexTrade, a leading shopping app, faced challenges in user retention, conversion rates, and revenue growth due to:

High Bounce Rates – Users leaving without making purchases.

Cart Abandonment – Many users adding items but not completing checkout.

Low Average Order Value (AOV) – Customers spending less than expected.

Intense Competition – Difficulty standing out in the e-commerce space.

This project leveraged Microsoft Excel to analyze sales data, customer behavior, and transaction trends, providing actionable insights to optimize the user experience, improve conversion rates, and increase revenue.

📊 Key Objectives
✔ Improve user engagement and reduce bounce rates.
✔ Increase conversion rates by addressing cart abandonment.
✔ Boost AOV by implementing pricing and marketing strategies.
✔ Differentiate FlexTrade from competitors with unique features.

Sales data (transactions, product categories, revenue trends).

Customer behavior (cart additions, abandoned carts, completed purchases).

Promotional campaign performance (discounts, offers, and their impact).

The data was cleaned, processed, and analyzed using Excel tools to extract meaningful insights.
